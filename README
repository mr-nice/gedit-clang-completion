This is a experimental but working codecompletion based on clang.

Most of the code is stolen from gedit-haxe-completion [1] and refactored to use
clang instead of haxe :)

Therefore please ignore any haxe things like configuration options, etc. The
code still needs a lot of refactoring ;)

To install the gedit completion plugin, just do the following steps :

Execute the install-plugin.sh as user to have it installed for user only, or as
root to install it system wide.

Relaunch GEdit, go to Edit -> Preferences -> Plugins, and activate
Clang Code Completion.

You also need clang. That's it, you should be good to go.
